## üìå Project Overview

This project explores the theoretical understanding, practical implementation, and ethical considerations of modern AI tools and frameworks. As a group, we utilized **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**, and **spaCy** to complete tasks in classical machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.

The assignment was divided into three key parts:
1. **Theoretical Understanding**
2. **Practical Implementation**
3. **Ethics & Optimization**

## üß† Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

We addressed the following theoretical components:

- **TensorFlow vs PyTorch**: Key differences, use cases, and advantages.
- **Use of Jupyter Notebooks** in AI development.
- **spaCy vs basic Python** for NLP tasks.
- **Comparative analysis** between Scikit-learn and TensorFlow in terms of:
  - Target applications
  - Beginner-friendliness
  - Community support

üìÑ *Answers are provided in the pdf above

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Practical Implementation

### üîπ Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn
- **Dataset**: Iris Species Dataset
- **Model**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Steps**:
  - Preprocessing (handling missing values, label encoding)
  - Model training and evaluation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

‚úÖ Achieved test accuracy: **98%**

### üîπ Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow
- **Dataset**: MNIST Handwritten Digits
- **Model**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Goal**: Achieve >95% test accuracy
- **Outputs**: Predictions visualized on 5 sample images

‚úÖ Achieved test accuracy: **98%**

### üîπ Task 3: NLP with spaCy
- **Dataset**: Amazon Product Reviews
- **Tasks**:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract product names and brands
  - Sentiment analysis using rule-based approach

## ‚öñÔ∏è Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

### Ethical Reflection
We explored potential biases in our models, particularly:
- MNIST: Risk of dataset bias and lack of representation
- Amazon Reviews: Sentiment misclassification based on informal language

We discussed mitigation strategies using:
- **TensorFlow Fairness Indicators**
- **spaCy rule-based filters**

### Troubleshooting Challenge
We debugged a TensorFlow script with issues like:
- Shape mismatches
- Incorrect loss function

both of script are in the above repo
